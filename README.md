# Culvert_Beta
#
# This a modification of the original code found in the repository CulvertEvaluation. The biggest changes are:
#
# 1. Includion of a loader.py file that allows the user to load imput data based on headers rather than column numbers
# 2. The final output is now produced in the return_periods.py file rather than having a separate file for that purpose. 
#   (i.e. the final_output.py file is no longer necessary)
# 3. More extensive commenting 
#
# The code is still being tested
